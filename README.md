# Simple-AI-Chatbot-
A Mini QA Platform project. This project demonstrates cost-effective AI implementation, full-stack development, and practical applications of NLP in Q&amp;A systems.

Project: AI-Powered Mini Q&A Platform

Built a lightweight AI-driven Question & Answering platform that provides accurate responses using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-based AI. This project is designed for efficiency, zero cost, and scalability, leveraging open-source tools and free-tier cloud services.

Key Features:
âœ… Retrieval-Based & Generative AI â€“ Uses FAISS vector search for fast retrieval and Hugging Face GPT models for text generation.
âœ… Scalable & Cost-Free â€“ Deployed using FastAPI (backend), React/HTML (frontend), and Render.com (hosting) at zero cost.
âœ… Smart Knowledge Base â€“ Stores data in JSON, SQLite, or Supabase, enabling efficient query processing.
âœ… Real-Time Q&A â€“ Users ask questions via a simple web UI, and the AI fetches or generates answers dynamically.
âœ… Deployed on Free Cloud Services â€“ Hosted using GitHub Pages (frontend) and Render/Replit (backend).

Tech Stack:
ðŸ”¹ Python (FastAPI, Flask), JavaScript (React/Vanilla JS)
ðŸ”¹ NLP & AI Models â€“ SentenceTransformers, GPT-2, FAISS, ChromaDB
ðŸ”¹ Database â€“ JSON, SQLite, PostgreSQL (Supabase)
ðŸ”¹ Deployment â€“ Render, Replit, GitHub Pages, Vercel
